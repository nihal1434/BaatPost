⚙️ Features

📝 Create and view posts
❤️ Like and 🔁 repost functionality
💬 Replies and comments
🤖 Pre-filled sample users (Abhay, Tanishka, Rishabh, Nakul, Nyl)
📱 Responsive design for mobile & desktop

🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox + basic responsiveness)
* JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)
* UUID via jspm.dev

🧹 Notes
Images must be stored inside the images/ folder or public/ depending on the build system
Avoid using file:/// protocol directly — always use a local server to support ES module imports (import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "https://jspm.dev/uuid")
On production (e.g. Netlify), make sure images are correctly placed under /public or root based on build tool
